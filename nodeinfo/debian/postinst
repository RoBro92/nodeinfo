# VLAN Configuration for nodeinfo
# 
# This file maps VLAN tag numbers to human-readable names.
# It is used to enhance the "VLAN/Subnet" section in the Proxmox Notes
# added by nodeinfo.

# --- Instructions ---
# Each line should contain a VLAN number followed by '=' and a descriptive name.
# Lines starting with '#' are comments and will be ignored.
#
# Examples:
# 10=Hypervisors
# 20=Media
# 30=Trusted
# 40=IoT
# 70=DMZ
#
# To edit this file manually:
#   sudo nano /etc/nodeinfo/vlan.conf
#
# Or via nodeinfo:
#   nodeinfo --vlan

# --- Begin VLAN definitions below ---
